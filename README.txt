This software is 100% legit. I am not trying to fool anyone, I know windows activators are sketchy but this one is genuine.

However it only works for the 2021 and 2019 editions of Windows 10 LTSC which is what the current editions of Winodws 10 MTR are based off of.

Compiled with BAT to EXE converter.
